Final Project for Game Development
Modification of Mario

This was actually fun. Challenging, but very rewarding to see the end result. Not a complete game, but a couple of cool features.

First, the level is predetermined, and designed to present the player with strategic choices. All the platforms and obstacles are in set locations. Bigger chasms, higher obstacles. The coins and the snails are still random however.

Second, added a Magic Mushroom (always at the same jump block) that give the player 5 seconds of increased speed and jumping ability. The color of the player changes also to indicate his super power state.

Third, added a ladder to enable the player to cross the final obstacle. This required adding two new states, PlayerClimbingState and PlayerClimbingIdleState. If the player is near (collided with) a ladder, pressing the up or down keys will make the player enter the climbing state. While on the ladder, pressing the left or right key will make the player enter the falling state.

Overall, a great way to wrap up the class! Thanks to James, Heidi, and Colton for the support along the way!
